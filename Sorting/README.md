## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## Selection Sort
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that works by iterating through the array and finding the smallest element at each iteration.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into the correct position.

## Merge Sort
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by breaking the array into smaller subarrays and then merging them back together.

## Quick Sort
Quick sort is a sorting algorithm that works by dividing the array into two parts, and then recursively sorting each part.

## Heap Sort
Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that works by creating a heap from the array, and then sorting the heap.

## Counting Sort
Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that works by creating a new array and then iterating through the original array, and then adding the count of each element to the new array.

## Bucket Sort
Bucket sort is a sorting algorithm that works by creating buckets for each element in the array, and then sorting each bucket.
